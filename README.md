# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, we practice our React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API. 
Technigo built a simple API to collect 'happy thoughts'. Think of it as our own version of Twitter, but with less negativity, and 100% fewer US presidents using it.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
